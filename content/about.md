# About
Born, Glasgow, Scotland in 1990.  I studied Computer and Electronic Systems (a joint degree
in Computer Science and Electronic Engineering) at the University of Strathclyde, graduating
with a Masters.

I am an adept programmer.  Cutting my teeth on Microsoft's QBASIC, moving
onto the likes of Java and C in university, and now - whilst still predominantly
working in Java - I also know Python, Ruby, Scala, Javascript and having dabbled in Perl,
and C++.

I love solving hard problems in simple ways.  I love jotting down a design and after some thought
being able to replace large complicated sections with a single part or existing service.
I also get a thrill out of seeing my designs come alive and start operating like the design
I made several months prior.

I cook.  Having started from the humble cheese toastie when I was about 12, looking for 
new foods to try and improving what I already know.

I game.  Like almost every kid growing up in the 1990s and 2000s, I became
infatuated with video games.  Enjoying shooters like Counter Strike and Team Fortress 2,
more cerebral games like Phoenix Wright or LA Noire, or just relaxing with some 
Cities: Skyline.
