# About
Born, Glasgow, Scotland in 1990.  I studied Computer and Electronic Systems (a joint degree
in Computer Science and Electronic Engineering) at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk), 
graduating with a Masters in Engineering.

I am an adept programmer.  Cutting my teeth on [Microsoft's QBASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic),
moving onto the likes of Java and C in university, and now - whilst still predominantly
working in Java - I also know Python, Ruby, Scala, Javascript and having dabbled in Perl,
and C++.  Having worked in areas of Big Data, Full Stack Web Applications and Micro-service Infrastructure

I love solving hard problems in simple ways.  I love jotting down a design and after some thought
being able to replace large complicated sections with a single part or existing service.
I also get a thrill out of seeing my designs come alive and start operating like the design
I made several months prior.

I cook.  Having started from the humble cheese toastie when I was about 12, looking for 
new foods to try and improving what I already know.  Currently I am trying to find out how
best to source and cook Tofu.

I game.  Like almost every kid growing up in the 1990s and 2000s, I became
infatuated with video games.  Enjoying shooters like 
[Counter Strike](https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/) and 
[Team Fortress 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/),
more cerebral games like [Phoenix Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Wright:_Ace_Attorney)
or [L.A. Noire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Noire), relaxing with some 
[Cities: Skylines](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/cities-skylines/CSCS00GSK-MASTER.html), 
or stretching my VR legs (and bullets) in 
[Hotdogs, Horseshoes and Hand Grenades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/450540/Hot_Dogs_Horseshoes__Hand_Grenades/).
