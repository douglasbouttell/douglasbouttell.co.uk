Born, Glasgow, Scotland in 1990. I studied Computer and Electronic Systems (a
joint degree in Computer Science and Electronic Engineering) at the
[University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk), graduating with a Masters
in Engineering.

I am an adept programmer. Cutting my teeth on
[Microsoft's QBASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic), moving onto the
likes of Java and C in university, and now - whilst still predominantly working
in Java - I also know Python, Ruby, Scala, Javascript and having dabbled in
Perl, and C++. Having worked in areas of Big Data, Full Stack Web Applications
and Micro-service Infrastructure.

I love solving hard problems in simple ways. I love jotting down a design and
after some thought being able to replace large complicated sections with a
single part or existing service. I also get a thrill out of seeing my designs
come alive and start operating like the design I made several months prior.

I cook. Having started from the humble cheese toastie when I was about 12,
looking for new foods to try and improving what I already know. Currently I am
trying to find out how best to source and cook Tofu.

I game. Like almost every kid growing up in the 1990s and 2000s, I became
infatuated with video games. Enjoying shooters like
[Counter Strike](https://store.steampowered.com/app/240/CounterStrike_Source/)
and [Team Fortress 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/),
flying around in planes in [Ace Combat games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Combat),
more cerebral games like
[Phoenix Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Wright:_Ace_Attorney) or
[L.A. Noire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Noire), relaxing with some
[Cities: Skylines](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/cities-skylines/CSCS00GSK-MASTER.html),
or stretching my VR legs (and bullets) in
[Hotdogs, Horseshoes and Hand Grenades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/450540/Hot_Dogs_Horseshoes__Hand_Grenades/).
