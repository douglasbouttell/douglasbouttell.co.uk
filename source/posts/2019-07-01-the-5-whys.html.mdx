[The 5 "whys"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) is a very simple but
powerful root-cause analysis method. The basic rule is that you keep asking
"why" until you find the actual cause of your fault (not just 5 times).

### For example...

"I was late for work." Why?

"My car wouldn't start." Why?

"The mechanic says the battery was flat." Why?

"Because it was an old battery and it was a cold day." Why?

"Because the last mechanic gave me an old battery instead of a new one." Why?

"Because they were cheaper and I wanted to save a few bucks." Why?

"Because I wanted to buy beer."

So the root cause here is: stop spending money on beer and more on keeping your
car running.

### But its not so simple

The example above was very simple but for real systems your 5 whys will get more
complicated. They will start branching (where one of your statements will
produce multiple new "whys") and you will need to know how to write your
statements and when to stop.

#### When should I stop?

I understand that the 5 whys could go on indefinitely or you could stop
prematurely thinking you've found the root cause (like just replacing the
battery in the earlier example, but you end up getting another old battery).

I have two general rules of thumb for this:

1. Reach the point where you have a cause that seems actionable and achievable.
2. Then go one level deeper. It may uncover a better cause, if not, you can go
   back to your previous cause.

In the example above, I could have stopped at the flat battery or the bad
mechanic, but diving that little bit deeper uncovered the real motivation.

#### What is a good 5 whys statement

Your statements should mention a tangible thing (the car, the battery, the
mechanic, beer) or the absence of a tangible thing. This allows you to either
dig deeper or take some sort of corrective action.

Try not to fall into the trap of thinking you have all the answers before you
start asking these questions. This ends up with a 5 Whys that is steered in a
particular direction to satisfy a pre-determined outcome and not as an exercise
in discovery.

Also, don't be afraid for the narrative to go to other teams. I have had several
narratives point to other teams as a root cause of outages. Just be sure to put
protections in place on your end in case the other team doesn't do what you ask.

## So what do I do with this?

The 5 Whys is a very effective mechanism for determining root-causes of faults
and errors. You should be using this in your defect reduction process and
sharing these findings so that everyone can learn from them.
