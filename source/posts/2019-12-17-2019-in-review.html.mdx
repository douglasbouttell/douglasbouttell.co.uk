Hey there. I'd thought I would put down my thoughts on how well things went this
year. Hopefully some of you can learn something from it.

## Work

### Launching a new product

At the start of the year we launched a new performance management product. The
original spec was to create a product where we could conduct tech work reviews;
match employees to those of similar job, location, tenure, etc.; and spread the
load evenly.

Our first issue was: time. We had been tasked to create this product around
late-July and was, initially, given a deadline of October. After much scoffing
and complaining, this was ultimately pushed back to February. Even with this new
deadline, we had to cut corners (read: testing and accessibility) to get
launched.

Things went well initially. However, the world of HR is very "gung ho" and
disconnected. Turns out, after launch, the key stakeholder for this product was
unhappy and was not consulted. This started a whole bunch of rapid improvements
which we had to deliver quickly to sate this key stakeholder.

On a positive note, our new product manager has been very inclusive and happy to
let the tech team get involved in building these new improvements. I think this
has yielded much better quality solutions that will keep our customers happier.

The key lesson here is that: you can move quick initially, but you will not be
able to move faster unless you stop and invest in your frameworks. It still
takes us weeks to get a service up and running, and months to get a product to
prototype.

### Burnout

Burnout is a thing
[and is dangerous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_overtime)! Having to
work extra hours is not your fault and you should not be obligated to do so
without additional compensation. All you're going to get for overworking is a
pat on the head and depression.

Having to overwork is a failure of management, more specifically: failure to
adapt to bad estimates; failure to push back and change deadlines; and
over-committing on features.

### Every day: 100 things to do, time to do 10

People are busy and will try to find ways to make themselves not busy. They have
an internal ranked list of what is important to them. A lot of the time - bar
their own promotion and pay - HR tasks are low down this list.

We have two solutions:

1. Make these tasks easy and quick to do; or
2. Get their manager to shame them into doing it.

### tl;dr

tl;dr ("Too long; didn't read") is a very important thing to consider when
creating a user facing product, especially one that users may use infrequently.

We have seen a trend in people who will not read text and just try to match the
UX pattern they know (e.g. finding the red button even thought this is an
irreversible delete action).

We rebuild the UX for one of our products to do two things:

1. Allow the user to do an action from multiple different points. This means
   that they don't have to remember a complicated series of steps from another
   workflow to do the same thing.
2. Provide a "fix this" button or link as much as possible. You should make it
   easy for your users to get rid of roadblocks you put up, especially if they
   use the product infrequently.

### Automate

More and more, we are realising that HR tasks should be automated (or
semi-automated). Things we have automated this year have yielded a reduction in
workload for us. We will be looking to see what other things could be automated.

### Accessibility

This year I have learnt a lot about online accessibility, however I am by no
means an expert. For newbie frontend engineers, I would recommend you read up on
[HTML 5 tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element),
[ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques)
(especially roles), and
[WCAG 2.1 Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/).

Thank you can start reading up on the
[whole WCAG 2.1 spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21) (try and get at least AA).

### Do it!

We have been relaunched as
[Day One Intelligence](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/doit) or
**DO**IT. This is part of wider org-level improvements.

## Personal Life

Unfortunately, my personal life has been little to non-existent. This is due to
work, commuting, anxiety and self-esteem.

I hope in the future that this will improve.
