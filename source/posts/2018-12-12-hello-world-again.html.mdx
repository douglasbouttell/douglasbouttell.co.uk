Hello Internet, once again.

So I haven't really used this site for over two years, been super
busy with work and the like.

Since I now know React from my work at Amazon, I decided to recode
this entire site using react-static. This gives me a lot more control
over the site structure and content rather than having to battle with
Hugo on how I include a simple static page.
